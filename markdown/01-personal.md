# Dương Hứa Toàn (Tony)

## Full-stack Developer

With 14 years working in IT industry, also in charge of some positions from analyzing to developing, team managing, deploying system, I have a deep understanding about software architecture & SDLC, which enables me to learn new technologies fast and easily. And 90% of my working lifetime is for startups, so I would love to work in a result-oriented and innovative environment. Along with high-demanded fullstack environment, I have forged myself a self-teaching skill that enables me to be adaptive with a changeable and high-demand environment.
